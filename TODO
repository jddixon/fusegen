    * problem: latency for at least one fsync exceeded 1 sec and        * FIXED
        so overflowed field (seen once in perhaps two dozen runs)       * FIXED
        - running on EC2 instance saw fsync latencies of 5-6 sec        * FIXED
    * default path to package is /home/jdd/dev/c/PKG_NAME; need a       * FIXED
        way to override the path                                        * FIXED

        never be installed by root

    * need a test program that exercises each and every FUSE opcode
    * need a fuseGen -L option which enables the generation of logging
        code
        - the package will then need a correlative 
            --fgLogging <LOG_FILE_NAME>
            option to turn it on; with a dash meaning STDOUT
    * need a fuseGen -C option which enables the collection of stats
        over a TCP/IP connection
        - the package will then need a correlative 
            --fgPort <PORT_NUMBER>
            with a reasonable default

2015-02-13
    * choose a better name than 'workdir'

        remembering that any braces must be doubled

    * in testFuseFunc verify that the list of FuseFunc returned  
        from calls to FuseFunc.parseProto can be used to reconstruct
        the text in the file FIRST_LINES
