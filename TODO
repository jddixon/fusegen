    * generated fsyncdir.inc is now wrong                               * FIXED
    * log_fi(fi); in the wrong place, at least in opendir

    * chmod, chown, utime are actually OK; add to v0.3.5                * DONE

    * need IFDEFs on all xattr ops, currently getting 2 out of 4 ?      * DONE
2015-01-27
    * ./diffEm getattr  # status test ??                                * FIXED
    * currently setting LOGGING_ENTRY for all ops -- check this is right

    * readlink call needs decremented size                              * DONE 
    * getattr needs only logEntry line :-)
        - need map from arg name to format (eg statbuf => 0x%08x)
    * need map from fuse op name to name of o/s call                    * DONE
    * FIX: running make in std_fs/src                                   * DONE
2015-01-25 (edited from -24)
    * add function getFuncMap which returns a map from a string         * DONE
        like 'getattr' to a FuseFunc object                             * DONE
    * replace makeParamLists with testFuseFunc                          * DONE
    * in testFuseFunc verify that the list of FuseFunc returned  
        from calls to FuseFunc.parseProto can be used to reconstruct
        the text in the file FIRST_LINES
2015-01-24
    * move most of makeParamLists into library (fusegen/__init__.py)    * DONE
