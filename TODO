    * opendir returning status of 1 = EPERM = operation not permitted   * FIXED
    * need a README.install which explains that you should not install
        this package

2015-02-17
    * FIX: any occurrence of the string xxxfs_ in fuseGen is an error
        - optable generation                                            * FIXED
        - readdir generation                                            * FIXED
        - configure.ac generation                                       * FIXED
    * FIX: if fuse file system is not umounted, a completely 			* DONE
        inscrutable error message appears when ./genEm is run			* DONE
        ('numerical result out of range: mountPoint')			        * DONE
        - should silently umount			                            * DONE
    * FIX: workdir/mountPoint is not mounting correctly; after			* DONE
        invoking bin/mountXXXFS, running tree gets an 'error opening	* DONE
            dir' message; after I run bin/umountXXXFS, this disappears	* DONE
    * URGENT: xxxfs executable must depend upon all *.inc
    * need better checks on rootdir, mountPoint in main.inc ChkDir()
2015-02-16
    * need a README.filesystem.generation which describes how to run
        fuseGen and thereby create the FUSE file system
        - main point: run ./autogen.sh
    * generated main.inc 
        - should verify that rootdir and mountPoint exist and have      * DONE
            acceptable names                                            * DONE
        - must remove any fg* options from the argv passed to fuse 
            (remembering to update argc)

    // FUSE VERSION 2.6 ADDITIONS
    * add utimens() - and deprecate utime()
    * add lock() 
    * add bmap()
    // FUSE VERSION 2.8 ADDITIONS
    * add ioctl()
    * add poll()
    // FUSE VERSION 2.9 ADDITIONS
    * add write_buf()
    * add read_buf()
    * add flock()

    * generate and test
        - bin/mountNAME                                                 * DONE
        - bin/umountNAME                                                * DONE
    * implement and remove from FIXUPS
        - src/fuse_version.h                                            * DONE
        - src/xxxfs.h                                                   * DONE
        - src/xxxfs.c                                                   * DONE
        - src/main.inc                                                  * DONE
        THE ABOVE HAVE BEEN TESTED MANUALLY
        - src/util.c

    * need a test program that exercises each and every FUSE opcode
    * need a fuseGen -L option which enables the generation of logging
        code
        - the package will then need a correlative 
            --fgLogging <LOG_FILE_NAME>
            option to turn it on; with a dash meaning STDOUT
    * need a fuseGen -C option which enables the collection of stats
        over a TCP/IP connection
        - the package will then need a correlative 
            --fgPort <PORT_NUMBER>
            with a reasonable default

2015-02-13
    * choose a better name than 'workdir'

2015-02-12
    * need to add workdir to Makefile.am 

2015-02-11
    * all blocks of C code in fuseGen should be reworked to use 
        python triple-quoted templates and expressions like {0:s},
        remembering that any braces must be doubled
        - fsync, mknod                                                  * DONE

2015-01-25 (edited from -24)
    * in testFuseFunc verify that the list of FuseFunc returned  
        from calls to FuseFunc.parseProto can be used to reconstruct
        the text in the file FIRST_LINES
