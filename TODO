2015-02-12
    * add autogen.sh in ./src; fuseGen must copy to build directory     * DONE
    * autogen.sh (AG) complains that libtoolize can't create ltmain.sh  * DONE
        in 'auxiliary directory'; add AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([config])       * DONE
        before the AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE                                     * DONE
    * aclocal, invoked by AG, complains that Makefile.am is absent      * FIXED
        - XXX Makefile.am is still incomplete; add text preventing
            installation (because of unacceptable security risks)
    * AG complains that configure.ac line 38 requires src/Makefile.in   * YEP
        - this is illogical, because configure creates the file ;       * YEP
            but just touching the file makes the error go away          * YEP
    * add dummy src/Makefile.in to build; XXX an ugly hack              * DONE

2015-02-11
    * as an experiment, generate bootstrap
        - it expects to find m4/
        - website suggests also running libtoolize and/or autoheader
        - they consider bootstrap an alternative to autogen.sh
    * add a PACKAGES file, need to install at least libtool for         * DONE
        libtoolize                                                      * DONE

    * there are a thousand versions of autogen.sh - look at a few!

2015-02-11
    * running libtoolize in the destination directory seems to          * DONE
        add many necessary files ... have fuseGen do this               * DONE
    * libtoolize rcommends adding LT_INIT to configure.ac               * DONE
    * ... and -I m4 to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am

    * generate configure.ac                                             * DONE
        - copied in autogen.sh to get this to work                      * DONE
            * have fuseGen copy in autogen.sh                           * DONE
            * ... and run autogen.sh
            * unless another source exists, put this in a subdir of     * DONE
                fusegen                                                 * DONE
        - but autogen.sh (well, automake) needs Makefile.am AND         * DONE 
            src/Makefile.in                                             * DONE
        - generated configure, which complained because xxxfs.c
            was not present

    * all blocks of C code in fuseGen should be reworked to use 
        python triple-quoted templates and expressions like {0:s},
        remembering that any braces must be doubled
        - fsync, mknod                                                  * DONE
2015-02-07
    * std has XXX_FS_DATA but ucName is XXXFS_DATA                      * FIXED
    * invisible difference between generated and std init.inc           * OK ?!
    
2015-02-04
    * log_fi(fi); in the wrong place, at least in opendir               * FIXED

2015-02-02
    * PENDING:
        - mknod     # var int fd; open returns fd; syscall param 2      * DONE
                        is fi->flags                                    * DONE
        - read      # syscall param 1 is fi->fh                         * DONE
        - write     # syscall param 1 is fi->fh; logEntry size is %lld  * DONE
        - getxattr  # logEntry treats value as string                   * DONE
        - listxattr                                                     * DONE
        - opendir   # var Dir *dp; fi-fh assigned; syscall returns dp;  * DONE
                        dp tested for NULL                              * DONE
        - readdir   # fi->fh cast and assigned to dp                    * DONE
        - init                                                          * DONE
        - fgetattr  # syscall param 1 is fi->fh # SPECIAL               * DONE

    * setting LOGGING_ENTRY for all ops - check this is right

2015-01-26
    * getattr needs only logEntry line :-)                              * DONE
        - need map from arg name to format (eg statbuf => 0x%08x)       * DONE
2015-01-25 (edited from -24)
    * in testFuseFunc verify that the list of FuseFunc returned  
        from calls to FuseFunc.parseProto can be used to reconstruct
        the text in the file FIRST_LINES
