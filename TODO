    * src/xxxfs -h segfaults complaining that 'h' is an invalid 
        option, whether or not the rootdir and mountPoint args 
        are present
    * refine myGetExtents.c, makeGetExt

    * log doesn't know how to print tv[2] when logging utimens          * FIXED
    * most of the logs are a waste of time and space

    // FUSE VERSION 2.6 ADDITIONS
    * add utimens() - and deprecate utime()                             * DONE

    * problem: latency for at least one fsync exceeded 1 sec and
        so overflowed field (seen once in perhaps two dozen runs)
        - running on EC2 instance saw fsync latencies of 5-6 sec
    * default path to package is /home/jdd/dev/c/PKG_NAME; need a 
        way to override the path
    * amplify README.md and ghpDoc/index.md
    * generate logging information only if fuseGen -L
        - which enables an --fgLogging switch
2015-03-04
    * document setting up core dumping to /tmp/cores using rc.local
        and subsequent use of debugger
2015-02-22 (-18, rewritten)
    * need a README.install which explains that this package should 
        never be installed by root
    * rework comments and replace install.sh accordingly
        - see man install
        - model may be ~/extern/xen-api/scripts/install.sh
2015-02-17
    * need better checks on rootdir, mountPoint in main.inc ChkDir()
2015-02-16
    * need a README.filesystem.generation which describes how to run
        fuseGen and thereby create the FUSE file system
        - main point: run ./autogen.sh

2015-02-15
    * need a test program that exercises each and every FUSE opcode
    * need a fuseGen -L option which enables the generation of logging
        code
        - the package will then need a correlative 
            --fgLogging <LOG_FILE_NAME>
            option to turn it on; with a dash meaning STDOUT
    * need a fuseGen -C option which enables the collection of stats
        over a TCP/IP connection
        - the package will then need a correlative 
            --fgPort <PORT_NUMBER>
            with a reasonable default

2015-02-13
    * choose a better name than 'workdir'

2015-02-12
    * need to add workdir to Makefile.am 

2015-02-11
    * all blocks of C code in fuseGen should be reworked to use 
        python triple-quoted templates and expressions like {0:s},
        remembering that any braces must be doubled
        - fsync, mknod                                                  * DONE

    * in testFuseFunc verify that the list of FuseFunc returned  
        from calls to FuseFunc.parseProto can be used to reconstruct
        the text in the file FIRST_LINES
