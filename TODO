    * std has XXX_FS_DATA but ucName is XXXFS_DATA                      * FIXED
    * invisible difference between generated and std init.inc

    * log_fi(fi); in the wrong place, at least in opendir

    * PENDING:
        - mknod     # var int fd; open returns fd; syscall param 2 
                        is fi->flags
        - read      # syscall param 1 is fi->fh
        - write     # syscall param 1 is fi->fh; logEntry size is %lld
        - getxattr  # logEntry treats value as string
        - listxattr
        - opendir   # var Dir *dp; fi-fh assigned; syscall returns dp; 
                        dp tested for NULL
        - readdir   # fi->fh cast and assigned to dp
        - init                                                          * DONE
        - fgetattr  # syscall param 1 is fi->fh

    * currently setting LOGGING_ENTRY for all ops -- check this is right

    * getattr needs only logEntry line :-)
        - need map from arg name to format (eg statbuf => 0x%08x)

    * in testFuseFunc verify that the list of FuseFunc returned  
        from calls to FuseFunc.parseProto can be used to reconstruct
        the text in the file FIRST_LINES
