    * FIX: xxxfs found in fuseGen                                       * DONE
    * add instrumentation code to {0:s}.h                               * DONE

2015-02-24
    * to prevent scrambling of log messages, open the log in append     * DONE
        mode                                                            * DONE
    * ah, but log messages then must not be split into separate         * DONE
        parts; so fix                                                   * DONE
        - LOG_FIELD to produce a single formatted string                * DONE
        - logContext() to concatenate LOG_FIELD strings to produce		* DONE
            and log a single message	                        		* DONE
            * need a glue function ('msgJoin' or similar)	    		* DONE
            * possibly copy data structure, pass that to buffer,		* DONE
                and return; with logging done in a separate thread		* DONE
        - ditto for logConn()			                                * DONE
        - and for logFI()			                                    * DONE

        - and for logStatVFS()			                                * DONE

2015-02-22 (-18, rewritten)
    * need a README.install which explains that this package should 
        never be installed by root
    * rework comments and replace install.sh accordingly
        - rm src/install.sh                                             * DONE
        - see man install
        - model may be ~/extern/xen-api/scripts/install.sh
    * if you attempt to mount fs which is already mounted (that is,		* OK
        run bin/mountPKG_NAME a second time), you get a 'usage' 		* OK
        message 		                                                * OK

2015-02-22 (from -21, edited, extended)
    * URGENT: FIX: can't tree workdir (again), something is screwing 
        up mounting the mountPoint, no hint in logs
        - this is possibly related to stdfs and xxxfs both using the
            same name (xxxfs)
            * wrong, no change after reboot, when stdfs definitely not 
                mounted)
        - major clue: the problem goes away if I reboot paloalto
            * WRONG, the tree succeeds until you create a file under
                rootdir/, at which point mountdir/ disappears from
                the tree
        - /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts contain a list of mounted file 
            systems; the latter is more reliable but the former may
            be more informative
            * there is of course a race condition involved
    * bin/mount now works, but any file access (touch, read, write,
        rm, ls) trashes the mount point
        - "ls: cannot open directory workdir/mountPoint: Transport
            endpoint is not connected"
        - first tree works, but after that tree cannot see mountPoint
        - nothing appears in the log, including the file access that
            trashed the mountPoint

    * drop COMPLEX_LOGGING                                              * DONE
    * set -s (single-threaded) in script mounting fuse file system      * DONE
        (a temporary fix for the log being scrambled)                   * DONE
    * FIX: log is screwed up because of lack of concurrency control 
        (messages are intermixed 

2015-02-17
    * URGENT: xxxfs executable must depend upon all *.inc
    * need better checks on rootdir, mountPoint in main.inc ChkDir()
2015-02-16
    * need a README.filesystem.generation which describes how to run
        fuseGen and thereby create the FUSE file system
        - main point: run ./autogen.sh
    * generated main.inc 
        - must remove any fg* options from the argv passed to fuse 
            (remembering to update argc)

    // FUSE VERSION 2.6 ADDITIONS
    * add utimens() - and deprecate utime()
    * add lock() 
    * add bmap()
    // FUSE VERSION 2.8 ADDITIONS
    * add ioctl()
    * add poll()
    // FUSE VERSION 2.9 ADDITIONS
    * add write_buf()
    * add read_buf()
    * add flock()

2015-02-15
    * need a test program that exercises each and every FUSE opcode
    * need a fuseGen -L option which enables the generation of logging
        code
        - the package will then need a correlative 
            --fgLogging <LOG_FILE_NAME>
            option to turn it on; with a dash meaning STDOUT
    * need a fuseGen -C option which enables the collection of stats
        over a TCP/IP connection
        - the package will then need a correlative 
            --fgPort <PORT_NUMBER>
            with a reasonable default

2015-02-13
    * choose a better name than 'workdir'

2015-02-12
    * need to add workdir to Makefile.am 

2015-02-11
    * all blocks of C code in fuseGen should be reworked to use 
        python triple-quoted templates and expressions like {0:s},
        remembering that any braces must be doubled
        - fsync, mknod                                                  * DONE

2015-01-25 (edited from -24)
    * in testFuseFunc verify that the list of FuseFunc returned  
        from calls to FuseFunc.parseProto can be used to reconstruct
        the text in the file FIRST_LINES
